# ü™Å Kite

**Kite aims to replace C, C++ and Java.**

Kite is designed to be as simple as C, with zero-cost abstractions like C++ and with a large standard library inspired by Java.

### About the Kite Language

**Kite** is a programming language for those who value the essentials of C, C++, and Java ‚Äî while rejecting the pitfalls and excesses these languages have accumulated over time. Kite it's NOT an OO programming language, it has structs that look like a class.

It brings:
- The **simplicity and efficiency of C**;
- The **ability to define user types (classes)** like in C++, but without the language‚Äôs complexity;
- And, like Java, the **organization of APIs in classes** and the design decision that **all object access is done via pointers**, making it easier to build a solid and extensible standard library.

At the same time, **Kite fixes key problems in these languages**:
- In C, fat pointers are missing, memory access is risky, and header files are an outdated burden.
- In C++, the language grew without limits and became overly complex, allowing the same thing to be done in countless different ways.
- In Java, the use of a VM and garbage collector hurts performance and removes memory control from the programmer ‚Äî something I consider essential.

**Kite is built on the idea that a programming language should not decide for the programmer, but rather assist them ‚Äî with clarity, control, and efficiency.**

It is a lean language project, with **support for inline (stack-allocated) objects that carry an internal pointer**, and a **strong focus on performance, predictability, and simplicity**.
